####  The experimental design taken. 

Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.
#### Background to the study: 
  Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.
  Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.
  
#### Define the question 
MAIN OBJECTIVE: How mobile money transactions can lead to greater financial inclusion for people who don't have access to banks.Greater financial inclusion leads to greater access to credit services, easier tax base to achieve revenues, better access to savings and fintech services.
The research problem is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. Your solution will help provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ financial outcomes.

#### Read and explore the given dataset
The main dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by individuals across East Africa. This data was extracted from various Finscope surveys ranging from 2016 to 2018, and more information about these surveys can be found here:  Dataset Files: Variable Definitions: http://bit.ly/VariableDefinitions [( http://bit.ly/VariableDefinitions)] Dataset: [(http://bit.ly/FinancialDataset)].
